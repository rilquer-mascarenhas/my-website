## Hello

My name is Rilquer Mascarenhas and I am a PhD Student in the [Carnaval Lab](https://www.carnavallab.org) of The City College of New York.

As a evolutionary biologist, I am interested in understanding the processes that drive the spatial distribution of biodiversity across different scales. I am specially interested in integrating different data sources and methodological approaches to investigate intraspecific genetic diversity.

My current PhD research focuses on evaluating the importance of ecology in population response to habitat change. My main goal is understanding how the ecological characteristics of species influence their interaction with the surrounding environment and shape the demographic history revealed in their DNA sequences. For that, I am utilizing machine learning tools, genetic simulations and publicly available ecological datasets for birds of the Neotropics.
