    "text": "My name is Rilquer Mascarenhas and I am a recent PhD graduate from the Carnaval Lab of The City College of New York.\nAs a evolutionary biologist, I am interested in the cross-scale processes driving the spatial distribution of different aspects of biodiversity. I am specially interested in integrating different data sources and methodological approaches to investigate the drivers of spatial patterns of intraspecific genetic diversity.\nMy PhD research focused on exploring the importance of species ecological differences in population response to habitat change. My main goal was to understand how species traits influence their interaction with the surrounding environment and shape the demographic history revealed in their DNA sequences. For that, I leveraged machine learning algorithms, individual-based genetic simulations and publicly available ecological datasets for birds of the Neotropics."
